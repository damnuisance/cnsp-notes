# 🗓️ CNSP 20-Day Study Plan

This is my personal 20-day study plan for preparing the **Certified Network Security Practitioner (CNSP)** exam by The SecOps Group.  
Each day is focused on a specific topic from the syllabus, blending theory and hands-on practice — with a daily commitment of around 2 hours.
